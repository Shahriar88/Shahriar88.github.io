# Md Shahriar Forhad â€” GitHub Pages site

This is the source for my personal site at **https://Shahriar88.github.io**.

## Quick start
1. Create a repository named `Shahriar88.github.io` on GitHub (public).
2. Add these files to the root of that repo:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `assets/Shahriar_Resume_23Sep_25.pdf` (optional; included here)
3. Commit to `main`. GitHub Pages will deploy automatically.
